# Tree WebAPI
This repository contains a simple WebAPI project designed for working with tree-like data structures. 
It was initially created as a test project for an interview, and the codebase is well-commented and self-describing to facilitate easy understanding and exploration. 
The project includes a SwaggerUI interface for visualizing and interacting with the API. PostgreSQL is utilized as the database for storing and managing tree data.

## Features
- Tree Data Structure: This WebAPI provides endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete tree-like data structures. It allows you to work with hierarchical data, making it suitable for various applications such as organization charts, file systems, or any scenario involving parent-child relationships.
- SwaggerUI: The project includes a SwaggerUI interface that provides a user-friendly way to explore and test the API endpoints. You can access the SwaggerUI by navigating to the /swagger endpoint once the API is running.
- Database Integration: PostgreSQL is used as the underlying database for storing and managing the tree data. The API endpoints are responsible for interacting with the database to perform CRUD operations on the tree structure.
